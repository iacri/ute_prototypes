#Trophy visibility in the minibossfight prototype

This prototype refers to the mini bossfight, where Eleven has to hit the speaker on the Seeker's head in
order to destroy it and be able to win the fight.
We wanted to see whether creating visual cues about what the player should do in this part was too invasive
or not clear, and that's the reason why you will see a trophy glowing when not in your hands and the Seeker's
speaker glowing when you have the trophy.

Move with WASD, press E to take the trophy in your hands and then press E again to throw it, exit with ALT+F4.
