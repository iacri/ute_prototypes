#First scene cutscene vs text prototype

This prototype refers to the scene where Eleven has to hide behind the counter and see the mannequin scene.
It tries to answer the doubt of whether it's better to use a cutscene, let the player move freely or let them
use a button to hide with a screen prompt to do so.

Move with WASD, follow the instructions, exit with ALT+F4. Three scenarios will play out in close sequence,
you have to wait at the end of each one for the other to play.
